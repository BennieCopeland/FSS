## Installation

Fss provides several libraries you can choose from:
- `Fss.Engine` Dotnet library used to create CSS.
- `Fss.Fable` Built on `Fss.Engine` and Fable to give some convinience functions when using Fss with fable.
- `Fss.Feliz` lets you write Fss with Feliz syntax. This is built on `Fss.Fable`
- `Fss.Giraffe`  provides helper funcctions that makes it easier to work with Giraffe. Built atop `Fss.Engine`

Just install the nuget package you need and you are good to go.

You probably want to pick a framework specific library unless you are doing something special or your are using an unsupported framework.
